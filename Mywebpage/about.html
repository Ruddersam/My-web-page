                            Hi, I'm Samuel, a Ghana-based computer science student at KNUST with a passion for solving real-world
                            problems through technology. I enjoy building modern, user-friendly mobile and web applications—most of my recent work blends
                            React Native on the frontend with Spring Boot on the backend. <br><br>
                            
                            I'm always curious and love exploring new ideas, whether it's designing elegant UI screens, experimenting
                            with authentication flows, or analyzing how systems work. My projects often begin as simple ideas and grow into
                            full platforms—like apps that connect workers to contractors or tools that help users manage daily tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond code, I have a deep love for aviation. I dream of building an Aviation Gallery that hosts aircraft
                            exhibitions, air shows, and flight-school experiences. I've also been interested in creating a spotting community here in
                            Ghana, connecting people who share the passion of watching and photographing aircraft.
                            <br><br>
                            I value teamwork and leadership; I've previously served as a Public Relations Officer and have worked with
                            teams of developers on real application concepts, balancing UI design, backend logic, and documentation.
                    <br><br>
                    Every day, I strive to learn, create, and share—to turn imagination into working solutions.
